# Startup-profit-prediction-using-multilinear-regression
we will be predicting the profit from the startup’s dataset with the features available to us. We’re using the 50-startups dataset for this problem statement and we will be using the concept of Multiple linear regression to predict the profit of startups companies.

How do startups work?

Well, we can say that startups pipeline operates on the same principles which are similar to other MNCs the major difference between both of them is that on the one hand startups work to make products that are beneficial for the customers on a small scale while other established companies do that work on a large scale by re-doing something which is already being done.


How startups are being funded?

As I mentioned above the startups are not such economical balanced company that has covered a path from an idea to a product so for the same reason no established investor will be going to come forward for those companies which don’t really have their market value hence, startups allow the early investors to start supporting in the format of seed funding which would help them to make a product out of their idea. In a nutshell, we can see that it’s hard to manage and analyze the investments and to make a profit out of them.

We need a way by which we can analyze our expenditure on the startups and then know a profit put of them!

How this model can help here?

This machine learning model will be quite helpful in such a situation where we need to find a profit based on how much we are spending in the market and for the market. In a nutshell, this machine learning model will help to find out the profit based on the amount which we spend from the 50 startups dataset.

About the 50 startups dataset
